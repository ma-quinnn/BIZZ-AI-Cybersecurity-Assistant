# ü§ñ BIZZ ‚Äì AI Cybersecurity Assistant (Work In Progress)

**BIZZ** is my personal AI-powered cybersecurity assistant, designed to support basic threat analysis and simulate detection logic ‚Äî like checking phishing links, suspicious file names, or simulated email scans.

This project is part of my self-taught journey from a non-tech background to becoming a future **Blue Team cybersecurity analyst**. It showcases my growth in Python, Flask, frontend integration, and cybersecurity concepts like incident response, log visibility, and basic automation logic.

## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me

Hi, I'm Mae ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Äî also known as **quinnn_** in the tech and crypto community. I‚Äôm a self-taught cybersecurity learner from the Philippines, currently working overseas while building my future in technology.

Right now, I‚Äôm focused on mastering:
- üîπ Blue Team skills: log analysis, SIEM (Splunk), and network fundamentals
- üîπ Python + Flask development for cyber tooling
- üîπ Deploying full-stack apps using platforms like **Render**

This project ‚Äî BIZZ ‚Äî is my way of combining **AI**, **cybersecurity**, and **real-world skill-building**.
