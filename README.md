# 🤖 BIZZ – AI Cybersecurity Assistant (Work In Progress)

**BIZZ** is my personal AI-powered cybersecurity assistant, designed to support basic threat analysis and simulate detection logic — like checking phishing links, suspicious file names, or simulated email scans.

This project is part of my self-taught journey from a non-tech background to becoming a future **Blue Team cybersecurity analyst**. It showcases my growth in Python, Flask, frontend integration, and cybersecurity concepts like incident response, log visibility, and basic automation logic.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm Mae ❤️ — also known as **quinnn_** in the tech and crypto community. I’m a self-taught cybersecurity learner from the Philippines, currently working overseas while building my future in technology.

Right now, I’m focused on mastering:
- 🔹 Blue Team skills: log analysis, SIEM (Splunk), and network fundamentals
- 🔹 Python + Flask development for cyber tooling
- 🔹 Deploying full-stack apps using platforms like **Render**

This project — BIZZ — is my way of combining **AI**, **cybersecurity**, and **real-world skill-building**.
